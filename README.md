Done:
render dumpling list
render dumpling detail
render header (add react router for home/list links?)

Todo:
Detail: 
  * change origin from id number to name property (api call, add new state)
  * add tags property (unsure of how response formatted)
Create:
  * add form, render form
Edit:
  * add form, redirect to detail page
Delete:
  * button. redirect to list/index page
User:
  * add registration/login/logoutfunctionality
Style
Tags/Origin: Need own Components/Controller to be able to add tags/origin data...
